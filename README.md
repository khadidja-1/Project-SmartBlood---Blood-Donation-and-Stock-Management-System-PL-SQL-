Project Title: SmartBlood – Blood Donation and Stock Management System
1. Overview of the Business Process
The SmartBlood system supports the end-to-end management of blood donation, laboratory processing, stock monitoring, and transfusion. The process begins when a donor requests an appointment and ends when blood is successfully stored or used for transfusion in a hospital. The system ensures accuracy, quick access to information, and real-time monitoring of stock levels for each blood type.
2. Objectives of the Process
	•	To simplify donor appointment scheduling and registration.
	•	To improve traceability of collected blood units from donation to transfusion.
	•	To support laboratory testing and ensure only safe blood is approved.
	•	To automate stock updates and reduce manual errors.
	•	To provide visibility for hospitals that request blood units.
3. Key Actors and Their Roles
	•	Donor: Books appointments, completes screening, donates blood.
	•	Mobile Collection Team: Handles registration, screening, and blood collection.
	•	Lab Technician: Tests blood, labels samples, approves or rejects units.
	•	Blood Bank Administrator: Monitors stock levels, manages inventory, updates records.
	•	Hospital/Transfusion Unit: Requests blood units and tracks transfusion outcome
4. Process Flow Summary
	1.	Appointment Request: Donor books an appointment through the system.
	2.	Screening & Registration: Medical staff evaluate donor eligibility.
	3.	Blood Collection: Blood is collected and assigned a temporary ID.
	4.	Lab Processing: Laboratory tests determine safety; unsafe units are discarded.
	5.	Stock Update: Approved blood units are added to inventory by blood type.
	6.	Hospital Request: Hospitals request specific blood types and quantities.
	7.	Transfusion: After approval, the unit is sent and transfusion details are recorded.

5. MIS Relevance and Organizational Impact
SmartBlood improves decision-making by centralizing information, automating manual processes, and ensuring data accuracy. It reduces delays, improves patient safety, and helps maintain adequate blood supply. The system also supports accountability because each action is linked to a specific user and department.
6. Analytics (BI) Opportunities
	•	Predicting blood shortages using historical donation trends.
	•	Monitoring donor frequency and identifying inactive donors.
	•	Tracking lab rejection rates to improve quality.
	•	Reporting urgent needs for specific blood types.
	•	Visual dashboards for administrators and hospital partners.
These analytics help optimize operations and ensure sufficient
